## About Tx

Tx aims to be oriented towards safety, speed, power and minimalism.

Tx is inspired by Lua. The code and implementation is based on the 
book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. The syntax and feature set
are inspired by languages such as Python, Rust, Wren and Swift among others.

The code is written, as much as possible, in modern C++. Trying to be 
almost completely constexpr.

## Disclaimer

Tx is still very much a work in progress.

## Documentation

- [Main documentation page](./doc/index.md)

## Backlog

- Maybe add option to error_token to mark the end of the token or the start in
  error message hint
- Tests for all the error_token() code paths
- File name in runtime error
- Multi-line entry in REPL
- Fix error in REPL in entry that follows an error
- Support expression result in REPL
- Reserve keywords pub, with, type, Type, abstract, override, final
- Better float formatting: 1.0e20 instead of 1.e20. Test print/parse loop
- Check arity/signature of native fn
- Fix TODOs in the code
- Replace runtime errors by compile time (keep runtime error in degug)
- Go over all the tests one more time (Some do not make much sense for tx
  and some others do not test all code paths)

### To consider

- Make not operator postfix and ! instead of 'not'
- Sync GC and allocator, meaning the GC is always triggered
  before the pool allocator falls-back to the upstream allocator.
- Chapter 25 challenges
- Chapter 26 challenges
- Allow "var a = a;" in the case of shadowing and not assigning to self
- Option to set maximum recursion level, starting stack and frame array size, 
  and minimum memory consumption (do not round to next power of 2)
- Optimize instruction_prt access (chapter 24 challenge) + benchmark
- Allow function overload with diff arities (if possible)
- Universal Function Call (UFC)
- Add OP CODES for common constant values (0,1,2,-1,"")
- Clean up utf8 conv, utf8 lenght, resize once
- Loop/block labels with support in break and continue
- Allow to use break to break out of a block (using labels only)
- Better const correctness for container elements
- Use char8_t and u8string_view (needs libfmt support)
